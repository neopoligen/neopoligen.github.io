v0.1 Launch Checklist

-- p

I&#x27;ve been working on Neopoligen for a couple years. I 
didn&#x27;t realize at the start that that&#x27;s what I was 
doing. Originally, I thought I was designing a file 
format to replace the one^md^^ I was using to make my 
website at the time.

Of course, in order to use the format I needed to make 
a site builder could understand it and covert it into 
web pages. The more I worked on that, the more I thought 
other folks might be interested in playing around with it 
too. 

Neopoligen is free and open-source^foss^^. Anyone 
can grab it and use it at any time, but I haven&#x27;t
publicized it. The app works and is what&#x27;s
building this site, but it&#x27;s not where I want it
to be before showing it to other folks. I&#x27;ve got a 
ton of ideas both on the drawing board and in-flight. 
The trick is figuring out when to draw a line in 
the sand and ship the first version. 

That&#x27;s what this post is about. I&#x27;m using it
to create the launch checklist. 

Once everything is checked off, it&#x27;s go time. There&#x27;s 
also a second list. Stuff I&#x27;m explicitly &lt;&lt;em|not&gt;&gt; going 
to do for launch. This is stuff I&#x27;m tempted to wait
for, but you gotta draw a line somewhere otherwise
it&#x27;ll never get out the door. 

So, here&#x27;s those lists:

-- todo
-- title: Do Before Launch

[] You can download and run the app on Windows 
and Macs

[] Auto-generate playground&#x2f;example site

[] Button to make a new website

[] Create the Quick-Start tutorial and videos

[] Guide to deploying on GitHub

[] Guide to registering a domain name on Hover

[x] Convert format to &quot;neojinja&quot;

[x] Images work with just their filename

[x] Images work from template site.image calls

[x] Blog posts work

[x] Button to neo content show source on every page

[x] Content files parse and render properly

[x] Link collection menus work

[x] Previous&#x2f;Next links work


-- todo
-- title: Don&#x27;t Do Before Launch

[] RSS Feeds - As much as I&#x27;d like to have them
for launch there&#x27;s still work on collections
that needs to be done first

[] Database Files - I really like &lt;&lt;ilink: 2djkslaj|this 
idea I had last night&gt;&gt;. Basically, have files with
content that doesn&#x27;t get published directly but 
gets included on other pages. Something clicked when
I had the idea. I think it&#x27;s gonna be super useful. 
The temptation to wait until its ready to launch
is strong, but we&#x27;re gonna let it show up in 
a future version. 

[] Plugins - The architecture foundation for plug-ins is set 
up. There&#x27;s enough basic structure to have confidence 
in the approach. 

[] Linux Version - Part of the app is a command line tool
that does the actual site build. If you use linux there&#x27;s
a good chance you can &lt;&lt;link|dig into the repo|https:&#x2f;&#x2f;github.com&#x2f;neopoligen&#x2f;neopoligen&gt;&gt;
to compile and run it yourself. 

[] Integrated Editor - Okay, there wasn&#x27;t a big danger of
waiting for this to launch, but it still tickles my brain
so I&#x27;m putting it on the don&#x27;t do list. Eventually, 
you&#x27;ll be able to edit the website content files directly
in the app, but that&#x27;s for a future version.

[] Sitemap - Like feeds, this is something I want to get 
in place quickly, but the initial set of content loaders have to
be built first

[] Turn unknown sections into standard sections -
This one is going to cause some frustration. If 
you try to add a section to a file and that section
doesn&#x27;t exist the page won&#x27;t render. I&#x27;m still going
back and forth on how I want to handle that. One 
way would be to just make things a standard section which
I think is what I&#x27;m going to do. That&#x27;s going to take a decent
amount of work (I think) so probably won&#x27;t make initial launch

[] Automatic Alt Text Ingestion From Image Metadata - I&#x27;m writing
a post about this one. This is one of those things where I should
have just been able to install a package and have it work,
but that&#x27;s far from the case. Photoshop doesn&#x27;t appear to 
support Alt Text metadata attribute that were added to 
the official standard (IPTC) two years ago. If Neopoligen 
gets funded creating an app and let yous read&#x2f;write&#x2f;edit
alt text in metadata is gonna happen

[] The Roadmap - All the stuff on &lt;&lt;ilink: 2cfuahxq|The Roadmap&gt;&gt;

&quot;Free and open-source&quot; software has two key parts:

- &quot;Free&quot;, as in you can download and run the app
without having to pay for it, and,

- &quot;Open-source&quot; which means you&#x27;re also free to
download all the code files that are used to make
the app itself. You can see exactly how everything
is put together and even change things for yourself.
Even better, if you make a change you think other
folks would like, you can &lt;&lt;ilink: 2djscgxe|submit it to the 
official version of the app&gt;&gt;
