<p>

Making your own website builder is generally considered 




a silly thing to do. There are a ton of great site 




generators out there. If you're goal is simply to build 




a website, spending time "reinventing the wheel" isn't 




worth it. 

</p>




    
<p>

So, why did I build my own? Because, it wasn't 




about the websites. It was about replacing markdown.

      The Case Against Markdown
    
    </h2>
    
  

  

  

</hgroup>






    
<p>

I started using Markdown

<sup><a 
    href="#fnref-1-text"
    id="fnref-1-link"
    >1</a></sup>


 for my notes for as soon




as learned about the format. I love writing notes




in plain

-

text files. I also publish a huge chunk of




my notes on my website. So, having a format that




outputs to HTML is ideal. 

</p>




    
<p>

There are things I don't like about it though

:

</p>





    

    

    

</section>
<ul class="flow">


<li class="flow">


<p>

It's very limited in what you can do with it. 




Basically just headings, lists, links, basic images,




and code blocks

      The Case Against MDX, Etc...

<p>

I started looking at MDX when I hit my frustration 




limit with Markdown. It looked promising, but 




after getting it to work I realized I don't really




like working with the JSX. 

</p>




    
<p>

I took a look at Markdoc and some other formats




too. They offered different feature sets, but nothing




quite did what I wanted. So, I decided to start




from scratch.

      Designing Neopolitan
    
    </h2>
    
  

  

  

  

  

</hgroup>






    
<p>

My website is over twenty years old. I've moved content 




repeatedly over the decades. I've used plain HTML, 




wordpress, django databases, ruby on rails, custom databases, 




markdown, MDX, and probably a few other things I've forgotten. 

</p>




    
<p>

I never want to have to migrate content again. 

</p>




    
<p>

That meant coming up with a single format that could do everything I can




think of at the moment and everything I can envision wanting to




do in the future. All without relying on a framework or specific language. 

</p>




    
<p>

I ended up with the format I'm calling Neopolitan. I tried to 




keep it as simple as possible.

      Templates Not JavaScript
    
    </h2>
    
  

  

  

</hgroup>






    
<p>

I'm tired of jumping JavaScript frameworks. One of the 




final straws that sent me down the path of making my




own site generator was  when I went fix a spelling 




error on a site I hadn't touched in a few months and




everything broke because some dependency in the 




framework changed. 

</p>




    
<p>

Neopoligen is pretty basic at it's core. It parses




Neopolitan files to create ASTs that are sent




to the template engine for rendering. There's still




some things to add to the AST, but the goal is to




get the point where any changes are additive so that 




existing templates will always continue to work with 




future updates.

      Neopolitan Sections And Spans
    
    </h2>
    
  

  

</hgroup>






    
<p>

You can read more details about how the format works on 




<a href="/en/2ikuxluk/?page=neopoligen">the home page</a>


, but it mainly breaks down




like this

:

</p>





    

    

</section>
<ul class="flow">


<li class="flow">


<p>

Each page is made of sections

</p>



</li>


<li class="flow">


<p>

Each section has a defined type

</p>



</li>


<li class="flow">


<p>

Each section can have attributes

</p>



</li>


<li class="flow">


<p>

The content in each section can have spans

</p>



</li>


<li class="flow">


<p>

Each span has a defined type

</p>



</li>


<li class="flow">


<p>

Each span can have attributes

</p>



</li>



</ul>


<section class="p-section flow">


      
        
<p>

The most important point about the sections and spans




is that they are arbitrary. The default theme ships




with several basic ones to get started, but you can make 




new ones on the fly.

</p>

      

      
        
<p>

There's not a lot to it, but that's kinda the point. 




Complexity is friction and friction keeps me from




making things. I want to reduce it as much as 




possible.

<p>

Neopolitan sections open with a line that has two 




dashes followed by the kind of section. For example

:

</p>





    

    

</section><section class="neo-example pre-section">



<pre>-- note

Section attributes are created by adding lines

section line. For example, here's a "class" attribute




added to a "p" section to apply a CSS style to 




the section to change the of the text

:

      Section Templates
    
    </h2>
    
  

  

</hgroup>






    
<p>

Neopoligen works by mapping the different types of 




sections to corresponding MiniJinja

<sup><a 
    href="#fnref-4-text"
    id="fnref-4-link"
    >4</a></sup>


 templates

<sup><a 
    href="#fnref-5-text"
    id="fnref-5-link"
    >5</a></sup>


. 




There are several templates built into the app, but you 




can also make your own. For example, here's a section type




 I made called "book

-

to

-

read

-

example"

:

</p>

<section class="p-section flow">


      
        
<p>

It's important to point out that there's no difference




between the templates that ship with Neopoligen and the




ones you make. You can make as many arbitrary sections




as you want. They are all treated the same way.

<p>

Each section has a default template. Additional 




templates can be built for them as well. Switching 




to one of the alternates is done by adding a 




"template" attribute to the section. 

</p>

Here's the same example as above but calling




a template called "alt"

One of the biggest differences between Neopolitan and




markdown is that sections can be nested. This is done




by adding a "/" to the end of a section name where




you want the nesting to start and then closing the




nesting with a corresponding section that starts with 




a "/". For example

:

Spans are sections of content that look like this

</section>


<section class="p-section flow">

They work similar to sections in the each one has




a corresponding template. Spans default to putting




their text inside the corresponding HTML tag (e.g.

Spans can take optional attributes. They can be




used for things like setting a CSS class on them.

Span templates don't have to map directly to HTML 




tags. They can be used to create more complicated




output. Take this "tablink" for example

:

</p>





    

    

</section><section class="neo-example pre-section">



<pre>&lt;&lt;tablink|text to link|https:&#x2f;&#x2f;www.example.com&gt;&gt;</pre>


    
</section>






<section class="p-section flow">


      
        
<p>

It's used to create a link to another page that




opens in a different tab like this

:

</p>

      





    


</section>


<section class="neo-example p-section flow">

</p>

      





    


</section>


<section class="p-section flow">


      
        
<p>

The template creates the link, points it to the "

target for the new tab, and then appends the character




to identify that it's going to a new tab.

to make sure it's doing the right thing. All the tests




are run each time a site is generated and a report shows




any errors. 

</p>




    
<p>

The tests themselves are done in Neopolitan files that




look like this

      Adding CSS
    
    </h2>
    
  

  

  

</hgroup>






    
<p>

My website includes a lot of my notes. Lots of those




have little pieces of CSS. To help accommodate this I use a 




<code class=""><span class="text plain">-- css</span></code>

 section type. The default template 




for the section type is empty. So, nothing renders




directly on the page. Instead I added the content 




of the section to the 

<

head

>

 of the document at the 




page level (which is just another template). 

</p>




    
<p>

Of course, since it's a section, we can create a new template




that 

<em 

>does</em>

 output its contents and call it




to show the code on the page too. For example, this




adds css for the 

<code class=""><span class="source css"><span class="meta selector css"><span class="entity other attribute-name id css"><span class="punctuation definition entity css">#</span>count_btn</span></span></span></code>

 to the




page

<p>

I get hugely frustrated when I'm reading a blog post




where someone puts in CSS that they say does something




but when you copy/paste it it doesn't work. This goes




a long way to avoiding that since the code displayed 




on the page is literally the same code that's in




the 

<

head

>

 of the document.

      Adding HTML

<p>

Adding HTML on the page is done in a similar manner 




to CSS. The biggest difference is that it outputs




where you put it instead of in the 

<

head

>

 of the




document. So, this

:

</p>





    

    

</section><section class="neo-example pre-section">



<pre>-- html

&lt;button&gt;This button does nothing&lt;&#x2f;button&gt;</pre>

<section class="p-section flow">

<section class="neo-example html-section">

<button>This button does nothing</button>

</section>

<section class="note-section">

<div class="note-title">
Note</div>

<div class="flow">


      
        
<p>

The red/bold font in the button is from the 




CSS that was added to the page in the 




example above. 

</p>

that show the source code along with the actual

I love footnotes. They make it easier for me to write

I used to be a professional photographer. I don't shoot




as much these days, but I still want it to be easy to

</hgroup>






    
<p>

Another image related thing I always found a pain was dealing




with the paths for the images. Neopoligen deals with this




by calling images by name regardless of where they are stored




in the source images directory. The data returns to the 




template includes all the available responsive sizes for




building a 

<code class=""><span class="text html basic">srcset</span></code>

 attribute. 

</p>




    
<p>

You can also skip the extension. This means if you ever decide 




to to something like upgrading all your .jpg files to .webp, 




they'll continue to work without having to go back and re

-

name 




everything. 

</p>




    
<p>

The default way to call an image looks like this

:

</p>





    

    

    

    

</section><section class="neo-example pre-section">



<pre>-- image
-- large-test-image
-- alt: The words &#x27;Large Test jpg&#x27; are in dark blue
-- alt: text on a black background in the upper right.
-- alt: Most of a red circle shows up in the upper left,
-- alt: and most of the bottom is covered by a curved
-- alt: blue shape that just gives some shape for
-- alt: this test image.</pre>

<section class="p-section flow">


      
        
<p>

The example also shows how alt text can be added to




image including extended alt text that would otherwise




end up in a single very long line in the content file.

I'm refactoring the way images handling. The srcset and alt




text might not show depending on when you see this. And, yes,




if you have two files with the same name it creates a "race




condition" where you don't know which image will show up. 




I'm adding a feature to warn you about that, but either way




it's a minor issue compared to the convenience of not 




having to mess with file paths.

Photo Mechanic, Photoshop, Brdige, and Lightroom (the tools I use

Neopoligen is set up to automatically generate Open Graph images




that include the title of the page for use in previewing




on other sites. You can also create custom ones for individual




posts as well.

<p>

I love RSS Feeds. There's been a bit of a resurgence of them




recently and I want to participate. I'm still figuring out




the exact approach I want to use but Neopoligen will be able




to provide multiple feeds that can be filtered based off




different criteria (e.g. just posts, just photos, or everything)

<p>

I'm still working on this, but the basic idea is to create




a list of other RSS feeds and then include links to the 




individual posts as a form of timeline.

</hgroup>






    
<p>

This is still a work in progress, but the goal is to be able 




to query across all my content files to make collections out




of them. For example, I'm making a book section type. By adding




and 

<code class=""><span class="text plain">-- read</span></code>

 attribute to it I can create pages




showing what I want to read and what I've read independently. 




When I read a book, I'll update the attribute for it and it'll




move automatically. 

</p>




    
<p>

This is actually one of the most exciting things for me. The idea




that I can use flat files to store content and then query things




like a database opens the door for so many possibilities.

      Permanent URLs
    
    </h2>
    
  

  

</hgroup>






    
<p>

I don't want to have to think about URLs. And, if I 




ever migrate to new software I want to make it as easy




as possible to match the existing URls so I don't have to




do a bunch of redirects. To address this I set up 




Neopoligen so that every page must have an ID and that




ID is what's used by default for the URL. The base 




URL for any post is

:

</p>





    

    

</section>

<section class="neo-example pre-section">


<pre>/LANGUAGE/ID</pre>

</section>

<section class="p-section flow">


      
        
<p>

For example, this page is always available at

:

</p>

      





    


</section>


<section class="neo-example pre-section">


<pre>/en/2kn3czfj</pre>

</section>

<section class="p-section flow">


      
        
<p>

URLs are made more human readable to appending the




title in a "query parameter" like this

:

</p>

      





    


</section>


<section class="neo-example pre-section">


<pre>/en/2kn3czfj/?page=why-i-built-neopoligen</pre>

</section>

<section class="p-section flow">


      
        
<p>

Because of the way the site is served the title




can change and both the old and new URLs 




will continue to work without having to build




a redirects setup.

</p>

      

      
        
<p>

They aren't the prettiest URLs. I'm also unsure




of what the SEO impact of moving the titles to 




query strings is. But, I don't care. This is 




very much a case where I prefer function (designed




to prevent link rot) over form.

<p>

Because URLs are ID based it's trivial to use them




to create links between pages. Two built

in templates




provide links with either custom text or the 




title of the page being linked to. For example

:

</p>

I've been working on Neopolitan and Neopoligen 




for a couple years at this point. The idea above




are the refinement of all that time. My goal is




to be able to use the format and the engine for 




the next twenty years. But, even if the engine




doesn't last, I'm pretty confident at this point




that the format will stick with me.

<p>

It's been a lot of work, but I couldn't be 




happier with the results.
