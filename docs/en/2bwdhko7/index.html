    <p>What's This All About? <span class="faded">
The Question
</span></p><p>My site is 20 years old. When I realized that, it got me thinking  about the next twenty years. The idea of jumping frameworks every  year or two is exhausting. Not because of the tech. Because  moving content is a slog. That sent me on a quest. You're looking at the result.</p></div>

The Format
</span></p><p>I spent the past year working on a file format to replace markdown/mdx for my content files.  It's called <a href="https://www.alanwsmith.com/neopolitan/">Neopolitan</a> . The goal is to allow for flexible content types in plain-text  without requiring javascript. </p><p>To see what it looks like, scroll to the end of any page on  this site. You'll see a copy of the file that produced it. </p></div>

The Engine
</span></p><p>Creating a file format doesn't do a lot of good unless there's something to use it. That's what this project is about. It's a static site generator built specifically for Neopolitan. Ultimately, it's a personal project, but the ideas  feel sound so I'm open-sourcing it. </p><p>-a</p></div>
