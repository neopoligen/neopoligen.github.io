      Sections
    
    </h3>
    
  

  

  

</hgroup>






    
<p>

Neopoligen files are made from sections that start with two dashes




like 


<code class="">-- title</code>

 and 


<code class="">-- p</code>

. The name for each section




determines what happens to the content in it. For example, outputting 




a title or a set of paragraphs like above. 

</p>




    
<p>

Another type of section is 


<code class="">-- list</code>

 which looks like this

:

</p>





    

    

    

</section>

<section class="neo-example pre-section">



<pre>-- list

- the quick brown fox

- jumps over the lazy dog</pre>


    
</section>


<section class="p-section flow">


    
        
<p>

The output from that section looks like this

:

</p>

    


</section>




<ul class="neo-example flow">


<li class="flow">


<p>

the quick brown fox

</p>



</li>


<li class="flow">


<p>

jumps over the lazy dog

</p>



</li>





</ul>


<section class="p-section flow">



    
        
<p>

Some of the other default section types include

:

 

</p>

    





    

</section>

<ul class="flow">


<li class="flow">

      Section Attributes
    
    </h3>
    
  

  

</hgroup>






    
<p>

Each section can have "attributes". They can do things like 




change a section's appearance. Attributes are made by adding extra




lines start with two dashes after a section. For example, 




here's a 


<code class="">-- class</code>

 attribute that's used to make the




text in the section green.

</p>





    

    

</section>

<section class="neo-example pre-section">



<pre>-- p 
-- class: green 

The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</pre>


    
</section>


<section class="p-section flow">


    
        
<p>

This is what that looks like

:

</p>

    


</section>





<section class="green neo-example p-section flow">



    
        
<p>

The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog

    <h3 class="section-heading">
    
      Custom Sections
    
    </h3>
    
  

  

  

</hgroup>






    
<p>

Neopoligen works by using templates to control the




output of each type of section. It comes with several default 




sections, but you can make as many more as you want. 




As far as the app is concerned there's no difference




between a section/template combination you make and




one that comes with it. 

</p>




    
<p>

For example, here's a new type of section called 


<code class="">book-to-read-example</code>

 




with some attributes for the title, author, and cover image. 

</p>





    

    

    

</section>

<section class="neo-example pre-section">



<pre>-- book-to-read-example
-- title: The Peripheral
-- author: William Gibson
-- image: the-peripheral-cover.jpg

I&#x27;ve read a bunch of other William Gibson stuff and can&#x27;t
wait to get to this one!</pre>


    
</section>


<section class="p-section flow">


    
        
<p>

And here's an example of what it could look like

:

</p>

    


</section>





<section class="neo-example p-section flow">

<div>Book To Read</div>

<div class="book-grid">
  <div class="book-image">
  <img src="/neo-images/the-peripheral-cover/100w.jpg" />
  </div> 
  <div>
    <h4>
    The Peripheral

    <div>By: 
    William Gibson
    </div>
    

    
        
<p>

I've read a bunch of other William Gibson stuff and can't




wait to get to this one!

More details about how to make new sections are on the way




soon.

    <h3 class="section-heading">
    
      Spans
    
    </h3>
    
  

  

</hgroup>






    
<p>

Neopoligen supports adding different "spans" to text inside




sections. A span start with two less than signs and ends with 




two greater than signs. For example, here's an "em" span




that makes the text inside it italics

:

</p>





    

    

</section>

<section class="neo-example pre-section">



<pre>The &lt;&lt;em|quick brown&gt;&gt; fox</pre>


    
</section>


<section class="p-section flow">


    
        
<p>

The output looks like this

:

</p>

    


</section>





<section class="neo-example p-section flow">



    
        
<p>

The 


<em class="">quick brown</em>

 fox

</p>

    





    

</section>


<section class="h3-section flow">
<hgroup>

  
    <h3 class="section-heading">
    
      Span Attributes
    
    </h3>
    
  

  

</hgroup>






    
<p>

Spans can have attributes as well. Attributes are separated 




by a pipe character like this

:

</p>





    

    

</section>

<section class="neo-example pre-section">



<pre>The &lt;&lt;em|quick brown|class: green&gt;&gt; fox</pre>


    
</section>


<section class="p-section flow">


    
        
<p>

The output looks like this

:

</p>

    


</section>





<section class="neo-example p-section flow">



    
        
<p>

The 


<em class="green">quick brown</em>

 fox

    <h3 class="section-heading">
    
      Custom Spans
    
    </h3>
    
  

  

</hgroup>






    
<p>

Spans work of templates the same way sections to. You can make your 




own that have extra functionality as well. The 


<code class="">tlink</code>

 span 




is a good example. It takes the ID of another page on the site




and turns into into a link to that page using the page's title. 

</p>

<section class="neo-example pre-section">

</section>






<section class="p-section flow">

Which outputs this

<p>

Neopoligen uses files directly on your computer to create 




websites. You own them and maintain control of them. 




You can preview the sites on your machine. You have to




published them to a "hosting provider" to make them available




to the world. Neopoligen is designed to work with a free




service called GitHub Pages by default. 

</p>




    
<p>

Details on using GitHub




and other free services are a work in progress.

      Next Steps
    
    </h2>
    
  

  

  

</hgroup>






    
<p>

That's the basics of how Neopoligen works. There's more advanced




stuff like being able to nest sections and output collections 




of links that's on the way. I'm in the process of writing




up how the other parts work and will post them as they're finished. 

</p>




    
<p>

I'll be posting about progress on my 


<a href="https://hachyderm.io/@TheIdOfAlan">Mastodon account</a>




if you're interested. You can also checkout my personal site (which is
